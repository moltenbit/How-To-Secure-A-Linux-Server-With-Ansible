# How To Secure A Linux Server With Ansible
Ansible playbooks of ["How To Secure A Linux Server"](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server).

These Ansible playbooks are made to help install secure Linux servers faster.

## How to get started
1. Install [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
2. git clone this repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/moltenbit/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server-With-Ansible
  cd How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server-With-Ansible
  ```
 
4. [Create SSH-Public/Private-Keys](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server#ssh-publicprivate-keys)
  ```
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519
  ```
   
5. Change all variables in *group_vars/variables.yml* according to your needs.
6. Enable SSH root access before running the playbooks:
   
  ```
  nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  [...]
  PermitRootLogin yes
  [...]
  ```

7. Recommended: configure static IP address on your system.
8. Add your systems IP address to *hosts.yml*.

&nbsp;

Run the requirements playbook using the root password you specified while installing the server:

    ansible-playbook --inventory hosts.yml --ask-pass requirements-playbook.yml

&nbsp;

Run the main playbook with the new users password you specified in the *variables.yml* file:

    ansible-playbook --inventory hosts.yml main-playbook.yml

&nbsp;

If you need to run the playbooks multiple times remember to use the SSH key and the new SSH port:

    ansible-playbook --inventory hosts.yml -e ansible_ssh_port=SSH_PORT --key-file /PATH/TO/SSH/KEY main-playbook.yml

&nbsp;

Tested on Debian 12 Bookworm.

## Configurations
The playbook uses most of the settings from ["How To Secure A Linux Server"](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server) / my choices if the guide has more than one option to do something.

### Requirements
- sudo installed
- groups created for *sshusers*, *sudousers* and *suusers*
- new user created with the name specified in *variables.yml* and added to groups
- use of sudo limited to sudousers group
- use of su limited to suusers group
- passwordless sudo enabled for the new user
- SSH public key added to authorized_keys file

### auditd
Uses best practice rules from [Neo23x0](https://github.com/Neo23x0) 

### ClamAV

### Firewall: PSAD and Fail2Ban

### Lynis
Lynis is configured according to "How To Secure A Linux Server" guide and will run an audit + send the report as an attachment to your mail address configured in *variables.yml*.
Current Lynis rating is 77.

### Mail
For mailing I chose msmtp with the help from [Decatec's guide](https://decatec.de/linux/linux-einfach-e-mails-versenden-mit-msmtp/). This will send a testmail.

## Plans / ToDos

## Warning!
Read all tasks carefully and make sure they do not break your system before using these playbooks! Do not rely solely on the Ansible playbooks for security! It is your responsibility to make sure all settings you need have been set and are working. This is just a starting point! Depending on your needs and goals make sure to further secure your system.
